The file /CHickenBanana/CHickenBanana/image13.png is intended to be an image file. As an AI text-based assistant, I cannot generate image files directly. However, you can create or obtain an image that corresponds to the content of the story for that page and save it as "image13.png" in the specified directory.

If you need help with creating the image or any other aspect of your project, please let me know!
